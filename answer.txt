Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]

1. Can this sequence be considered correct?
    No

2. If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?
    There is an error in this example. Not all brackets have their own pair. 
    There are several solutions to this problem. 
    Here are two solutions:
        a) complete the missing pairs of brackets [[((())()(()))]]
        b) remove unpaired brackets [(())()(())]
